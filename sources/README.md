#### `sources/README.md`

Build process documentation, that explains the steps you take to build your sources into binary files.
This might also be named `BUILD-HOWTO.md` or `BUILD-INSTRUCTIONS.md`, but if it is named README.md then when you browse the `sources/` directory on Github it will be shown inline at the bottom of the page.
